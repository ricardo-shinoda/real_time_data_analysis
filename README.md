This repository is dedicated to Data Engineering study.
This is my first Data engineering project.

The goal here is to develop a real-time data analysis pipeline: Build a real-time data analysis pipeline that processes and analyzes large volumes of streaming data, such as financial brazilian market data.

This project would involve designing efficient data ingestion, processing, and storage mechanisms, as well as developing machine learning algorithms for real-time data analysis.
